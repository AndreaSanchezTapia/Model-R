# Model-R shiny app

## 2018/02/09

Currently the shiny app is working, just download the repository and open server.R or iu.R, then RunApp in RStudio.
However, our docker container build is having some problems - we're working on them.

We will soon include the latest version of the [modelR R package](https://github.com/Model-R/modelr_pkg) into the shiny app.
